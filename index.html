  <h3>About myself</h3>
  <p>Hi everyone, I am Synat, a research student at National Centre for Asbestos Related Diseases, University of Western Australia (UWA) in beautiful sunny Perth, Western Australia, Australia. My project looks into combining the radiotherapy and
    immunotherapy in mesothelioma with the aim of
    increasing the response rate of mesothelioma patients to immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Apart from my research,
    I love statistics and data sciences. I believe stats does play a key roles in every fields including medicine/medical research. We spend
    lots of time generating data from the lab and I think it is very important to do a proper analysis. I am not a statistician / data scientist by train. However, I have completed many units in statistics at The University of Western Australia
    including
    Biostatistics I (PUBH 4401) & Biostistics II (PUBH5769), Multilevel and mixed effects modelling (STATS4065) and applied statistics and data visualization (STATS 4067) for high dimention data.
    I also completed several short courses run by UWA centre for applied statistics including introduction to R, statistics in R, introduction statistics with SPSS and R,
    ANOVA, linear regregresion, multiple regression and logistic regression with R. Apart from that, I have also completed a few machine learning courses for data analysis through
    UWA Coursera enhancement units. I also enrolled in python programming bootcamp and data sciences bootcamp using python through Udemy. For my daily data analysis, I am using three programing languages
    including R, python and Julia. I previously used SAS during Biostatistics II unit.
